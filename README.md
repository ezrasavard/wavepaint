# WavePaint
Tool for Making Images from Music

## Purpose
I wanted a tool to create PNGs of time domain representations of songs.

Code operates on WAV files directly and may support other formats
in the future.

## Usage
To make a black and a white waveform of a song, use:

```wavepaint song.wav```

The outputs will be `song-black.png` and `song-white.png`.

The tool can also take a list of WAV files like so:

```wavepaint song1.wav song2.wav song3.wav```
